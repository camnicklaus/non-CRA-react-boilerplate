# React BoilerPlate. Because, you know... remembering stuff

## Instructions
clone this repo and then:  
* 'npm i' to install packages  

* 'npm start'  to run the dev server  

* 'npm run build' to create production ready files into the 'build' folder  

## Work in progress  

This repo is a work in progress!   
Still would like to:   

* configure the build folder to hold persistent static assets  
* split out html template, .css, and .js files in the build directory
